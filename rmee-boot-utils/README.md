Collection of small utilities missing form Spring Boot:

- Some Flyway logging on INFO level
- Spring-managed Hibernate listener supporting dependency injection.
- Proxy configuration trough Spring configuration mechanism.
- Spring Condition whether security is enabled.
- A SLF4J Logger for Sleuth that logs a single entry per request on INFO level.
- Logger showing information about endpoints on INFO level (TODO subject to be refined).
- Logger showing information about environment configuration on DEBUG level (subject to be refined).
- systemd ready signalling (TODO auto configuration to be added shortly)
